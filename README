===========
Description
===========
IOSSHy provides an easy to use desktop tool to quickly create and destroy SSH tunnels and launch commands based on a preconfigured setup.

Password are stored in the keyring provided by the operating system (ES: gnome's keyring, kde's kwallet, osx keychain, etc...)

-----
Usage
-----
Whe the program is launched, the main interface is hidden and only the icon in the system tray is shown.
By clicking the tray icon, a configuration dialog will appear which allows to specify the tunnel configurations.

A tunnel configuration consists of a name, the remote port that has to be forwarded locally, the local port (leaving this value to 0 will let IOSSHy choose a free high numbered port), an optional command to execute, and the ssh server details (host, port, and username). The password will be asked when needed.

The command like may contain a special string "{port}" (without quotes) that will be replaces by the local port used for the tunnel, making it possible to write commands like this: "rdesktop localhost:{port}"

SSH public key authentication methods are supported through the ssh agents provided by each operating system (putty's pageant is supported).

----------------
Example use case
----------------
Create a SSH tunnel to a remote host on the MySQL port (3306) and launch a program that uses the tunnel to access the database as if it was installed locally.
When the program terminates the tunnel is automatically closed.

============
Installation
============
The application should work reasonably well on all the platforms where the dependencies can be satisfied (Linux, \*BSD, OSX, Windows, ...),
but at this point has only been tested on Linux operating systems and Windows XP 32bit.
