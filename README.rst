** This software is work in progress **

IOSSHy aims to provide an easy to use desktop tool to quickly create and destory SSH tunnels and launch commands based on a preconfigured setup.

An example configuration would allow to create a SSH tunnel to a remote host on the MySQL port and launch a program locally that uses the tunnel to manipulate the database.
When the program terminates the tunnel is automatically closed.
